# Plug-in a Python upload endpoint for Imgur

Below is a concise “drop-in” snippet you can paste into your Replit backend (or any Flask/FastAPI microservice). It mirrors the Node.js flow you already saw, but written in modern Python 3 with the popular `requests` and `python-multipart` style handling.

## 1. Prerequisites

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv fastapi uvicorn python-multipart
```

1. Log in to Imgur › Settings › Applications › “Create Application” → pick *Anonymous usage* to grab your **CLIENT_ID**.  
2. In Replit ➜ “Secrets” tab, add `IMGUR_CLIENT_ID`.

## 2. Utility function: upload to Imgur

```python
# imgur_upload.py
import base64
import os
import requests

IMGUR_ENDPOINT = "https://api.imgur.com/3/image"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Client-ID {os.getenv('IMGUR_CLIENT_ID')}"}

def upload_image(file_bytes: bytes) -> str:
    """
    Push raw image bytes to Imgur (anonymous upload).
    Returns the public HTTPS URL.
    Raises RuntimeError on failure.
    """
    payload = {"image": base64.b64encode(file_bytes)}
    r = requests.post(IMGUR_ENDPOINT, headers=HEADERS, data=payload, timeout=10)
    if not r.ok:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Imgur error {r.status_code}: {r.text}")
    return r.json()["data"]["link"]          # e.g. https://i.imgur.com/abcd123.png
```

Why Base64? Imgur accepts either multipart files or a Base64 string; the latter avoids boundary-building complexity inside FastAPI.

## 3. Minimal FastAPI server

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile, HTTPException
from imgur_upload import upload_image

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/api/upload")
async def upload(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    try:
        bytes_data = await file.read()
        url = upload_image(bytes_data)
        return {"imageUrl": url}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

Run locally (or let Replit auto-run):

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

Your frontend can now `POST` a `multipart/form-data` body with a `file` field and get back:

```json
{ "imageUrl": "https://i.imgur.com/abcd123.png" }
```

## 4. Rate-limit & cleanup tips

- Imgur allows ≈1,250 anonymous uploads/day per IP. Cache + throttle if your converters get busy.  
- Save the `deletehash` (`r.json()["data"]["deletehash"]`) if you might need to purge abandoned images later.  
- Reject >10 MB files (`UploadFile.spool_max_size`) to stay under Imgur’s anonymous 20 MB cap.  

With these ~40 lines, your Python Replit agent can take any incoming file, push it to Imgur, and pipe the resulting URL straight into your image-conversion workflow.
